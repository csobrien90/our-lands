# Our Lands

*This is a simple web application for me to manage my lands. The interface is a map of our property, with the perimeter and grid system clearly marked. Each grid square can be clicked on to view details about that area.*


## Ideas

Gridded out map of our property

- fluidly adjust satellite/labeled view and property line (internal/external) opacity
- Segments outside our property lines are grayed out/disabled

Click on grid segment to open details page

Details:

- display basic hardcoded info: coordinates, which lot itâ€™s on, etc. things that can be hardcoded away from the land, and a zoomed image of this map segment
- start simple for trackables: running comments sections
- for future versions: topography, tree inventory, todo, etc.

Mirror Bandbook data permanence implementation strategy

- Local first web application
- Host online for transient use, work on server backup features while only I have account, then abstract for user profiles
